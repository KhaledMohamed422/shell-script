(As detailed in our </span><span><a href="http://tos.clubhouse.com/" class="notion-link link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms of Service</a></span><span>). Chats will appear in other users’ “feeds” and in other parts of the app, and in some cases may be shared by other users outside of Clubhouse. Chats are shared with others according to the privacy settings of the user that created the Chat (the “Chat Creator”). This means you can share Chats you create with your friends, your friends and their friends, or participants in a House. We retain your Chats indefinitely, unless you delete them, so that they can be played back by other users. A full Chat conversation may be deleted by the Chat Creator, or a specific audio comment (a section of an audio Chat or VM) within a conversation may be deleted by the person who created it. A “House” is a community you can join with users, where you can participate in Chats,and Live Rooms, and interact in different ways.</span></span></li><li id="block-f188d9cb8b6944c19eab60d5153fed51" class="notion-list-item"><span class="notion-semantic-string"><span><strong>Voice Messages (“VMs”)</strong></span><span>. Direct voice messages, which we call “VMs” or “Messages,” are voice conversations allowing you to send audio content privately to one person or a group of people (unlike Chats, which are voice conversations that you may share more publicly). These Chats may also contain attachments like links or images. We retain VMs indefinitely so that they can be replayed by the conversation participants, unless VM audio comments are individually deleted by the comment creator. If you start a VM, or participate in a VM with one or more users, those users will appear in the “Recently Chatting With” section of your profile, which will be displayed to your friends. Friends who visit your profile may press on a user’s photo (or group of user photos) that is displayed in the “Recently Chatting With” section to start a separate, new group conversation with you and the other user(s). Users who use the “Recently Chatting” feature to start a new VM conversation with you and others will not enter the previous VM conversation, nor can they listen to the content of the previous VM conversation. The audio content of your previous VM conversation will remain private only to you and your other VM participants.</span></span></li><li id="block-6e583941285c448ba2e6339f4e7717b7" class="notion-list-item"><span class="notion-semantic-string"><span><strong>Live conversations (“Live Rooms”)</strong></span><span>.

This is part of our commitment to users under our Terms of Service to work to provide a safe space for their Conversations and combat illegal and harmful conduct and content. If we receive a complaint while the Room is live, we will review the recording to determine whether a violation has occurred. We will retain the recording as long as reasonably necessary to investigate the potential violation.
