Wagering is determined upon bet settlement. <\/li><li>Upon starting the game you are given €1,000,000, and presented with your first question to answer. You can either split your money or go all in on one answer, you then need to lock your answer. Once a question has been resulted, any money put on the winning answer will move on to the next question.<\/li><li>Any money left in the pot after all 20 questions have been answered is yours to keep and will be credited to your account as cash. Can you keep the full Million until the end?<\/li><li>As soon as you have finished one The Betsson Million game you can start qualification for the next game for a chance to earn more prizes.<\/li><\/ol><h3>Who can take part?<\/h3><p>Any customer that has a registered Betsson account in an eligible country (see terms and conditions) and are eligible to receive promotions and bonuses. Opt-in for The Betsson Million game is required.<\/p><h3>How do I qualify?<\/h3><p>You will be able to enter The Betsson Million game after you have opted in, and cumulatively staked €25. Bets can be placed on any sports (excluding horse racing) with odds 1.50 or higher. If you place an accumulator or system bet, then one of your individual selections must have odds 1.50 or higher. All wagering will be determined on bet settlement, and if you cash out, or partly cash out your bet, it will not count towards the wagering criteria. As soon as you meet the wagering requirement you can ‘Start’ The Betsson Million game. Any additional stakes placed before starting the game will not count. If you start but don’t complete the full wagering of €25, the progress bar will be reset after 30 days.<\/p><h3>If I place bets while playing the game will it count towards the wagering requirement of the next game?<\/h3><p>You can only have one The Betsson Million game in progress at any given time and the €25 staking requirement starts from zero once one game has finished, and you actively start the qualification for the next game.<\/p><h3>How do I win?<\/h3><p>Any money that you have left after the final question have been answered will be credited to your account as winnings within 72 hours. Cash prizes up to €750 will be credited instantly. Winnings are yours to keep without wagering requirements.<\/p><h3>How many questions do I need to answer?<\/h3><p>The number of questions you need to answer will be displayed when you play the game, but typically this will be 20 questions.<\/p><h3>Do I answer questions one by one?<\/h3><p>Yes, once the question you have answered has been resulted you will be able to answer the next question. The time limit for each question is stated within The Betsson Million game.<\/p><h3>What is a pot?<\/h3><p>Usually the “pot” is known as your potential winnings, however for the Betsson Million game we give you your potential winnings up front and it is your job to keep it.<\/p><h3>How much of my money can I split?<\/h3><p>You can split your money between the two answers in any way you wish, you can put all of the money on one answer, known as “All-In” or put some money on both answers ensuring you will take some money through to the next question.<\/p><h3>What happens if I go ‘All In’ on one question?<\/h3><p>If you go all in, this means that if you pick the correct answer, all your pot will move on to the next question. If you are all in on the wrong answer you lose and be out of the game.<\/p><h3>What happens if I do not answer a question in time?<\/h3><p>If you do not answer the question before the time expires, you will be presented with a new question in the same game round. If you do not finish the game within 60 days your game is void and any potential winnings forfeited.<\/p><h3>What is The Betsson Million Leaderboard?<\/h3><p>The Leaderboard shows the top 100 players accumulated winnings from The Betsson Million game. For every cash prize you collect you will climb the leaderboard, and while there are no rewards directly tied to the leaderboard rakings, it demonstrates which players have managed to use the best strategy to win the most prizes from the game. <\/p><h3>How many times can I play The Betsson Million game?<\/h3><p>If this promotion is on offer you can play the game as many times as you want. As soon as one game finishes you can trigger qualification for the next game. We reserve the right to alter, cancel or withdraw this offer at any time.<\/p><h3>What are the minimum and maximum winnings?<\/h3><p>There are no minimum winnings. Any money remaining in your pot, regardless of how much, will be credited to your account in cash. You can win a maximum of €1,000,000 in one game round.<\/p><h3>How are results settled?<\/h3><p>Results are settled in accordance with our standard sportsbook rules.<\/p><h3>Where can I see my previous answers?<\/h3><p>Previous answers can be found under “History” on The Betsson Million page.<\/p>","text_rb_million_rules":"<h3>Terms & Conditions<\/h3><ul><li>You must be 18 years of age, or of applicable legal age in the jurisdiction you reside in (whichever is greater), to take part in this promotion.<\/li><li>This offer is limited to one person, family, household address, email address, IP address, telephone number, same payment account number (e.g. debit or credit card, Neteller etc), and shared computer, e.g. public library, or workplace.<\/li><li>By opting-in to The Betsson Million, and accepting the rules and terms & conditions, you agree to have the first name, first letter of last name, region and winnings displayed in the leaderboard.<\/li><li>Customers that have been informed that they cannot take part in any Betsson promotions will not be eligible to receive prizes in this promotion.<\/li><li>Opt-in for this promotion is required. Any bets placed prior to opting in does not count towards the wagering requirement.<\/li><li>To qualify, place bets of €25 in total on any sports (excluding horse racing) with odds 1.50+ (accumulator or system bets must have at least one selection of odds 1.50+). Wagering is determined upon bet settlement. Once you have placed your qualifying bets you need to ‘Start’ the game. If you don't complete the wagering or ‘start’ the game within 30 days from the time of opt-in, the progress bar will be reset to zero.<\/li><li>Bets that are tied to a reward such as Bonus money, Free Bets, Price Boosts, ACCA Insurance and Risk Free Bets, or bets that are cashed out, or partly cashed out, do not qualify towards the wagering requirement.<\/li><li>The Betsson Million game needs to be started once you have placed the qualified bets, and the bets have been settled. <\/li><li>Betsson does not allow ‘backing of both sides’ or betting on multiple selections within a market\/fixture combination that unfairly counts towards wagering for The Betsson Million. In market combinations that only have two or three potential outcomes (for example football Full-Time result or over\/under 2.5 goals), where you have placed bets on more than one potential outcome, either Pre-Match or In-Play, only the individual selection with your highest cumulative stake will count towards the wagering to start the game. Example: If you have placed a bet of €10 on Tottenham to beat Liverpool, and an additional €15 bet on Liverpool to beat Tottenham on the Full-Time Result market, only the stake of €15 - the highest stake - will count towards wagering. If you place an additional bet of €5 on Liverpool to beat Tottenham, then the full cumulative stake of €20 will count. In addition, this restriction also applies when you have placed bets on any market combinations, either Pre-Match or In-Play, that limits your overall risk. Only the outcome with your highest cumulative stake will count towards rewards. An example of such betting patterns would be if you place a bet of ‘Over 0.5 goals’ and an additional bet of ‘Correct score 0-0’. When placing accumulator bets, the bet size is calculated as a proportion of the overall odds. Read all rules <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betsson.com\/en\/game-rules\/sportsbook\">here<\/a>.<\/li><li>Bets made once a The Betsson Million game is in progress will not contribute towards future entries into the game.

If you are all in on the wrong answer you lose and be out of the game.<\/p><h3>What happens if I do not answer a question in time?<\/h3><p>If you do not answer the question before the time expires, you will be presented with a new question in the same game round. If you do not finish the game within 60 days your game is void and any potential winnings forfeited.<\/p><h3>What is The Betsson Million Leaderboard?<\/h3><p>The Leaderboard shows the top 100 players accumulated winnings from The Betsson Million game.

Wagering is determined upon bet settlement. Once you have placed your qualifying bets you need to ‘Start’ the game. If you don't complete the wagering or ‘start’ the game within 30 days from the time of opt-in, the progress bar will be reset to zero.<\/li><li>Bets that are tied to a reward such as Bonus money, Free Bets, Price Boosts, ACCA Insurance and Risk Free Bets, or bets that are cashed out, or partly cashed out, do not qualify towards the wagering requirement.<\/li><li>The Betsson Million game needs to be started once you have placed the qualified bets, and the bets have been settled. <\/li><li>Betsson does not allow ‘backing of both sides’ or betting on multiple selections within a market\/fixture combination that unfairly counts towards wagering for The Betsson Million. In market combinations that only have two or three potential outcomes (for example football Full-Time result or over\/under 2.5 goals), where you have placed bets on more than one potential outcome, either Pre-Match or In-Play, only the individual selection with your highest cumulative stake will count towards the wagering to start the game. Example: If you have placed a bet of €10 on Tottenham to beat Liverpool, and an additional €15 bet on Liverpool to beat Tottenham on the Full-Time Result market, only the stake of €15 - the highest stake - will count towards wagering. If you place an additional bet of €5 on Liverpool to beat Tottenham, then the full cumulative stake of €20 will count. In addition, this restriction also applies when you have placed bets on any market combinations, either Pre-Match or In-Play, that limits your overall risk. Only the outcome with your highest cumulative stake will count towards rewards. An example of such betting patterns would be if you place a bet of ‘Over 0.5 goals’ and an additional bet of ‘Correct score 0-0’. When placing accumulator bets, the bet size is calculated as a proportion of the overall odds.
