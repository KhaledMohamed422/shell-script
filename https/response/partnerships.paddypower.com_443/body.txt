</li>
<li>
Paddy Power has the right to reduce the revenue share of affiliates, or to terminate this Agreement and remove such affiliates, who do not deliver at least one new Customer in a given calendar month. We will notify you by email where such a reduction or termination will occur. Accounts that are inactive for a longer period (e.g. where you have failed to deliver at least one new Customer in the last six months) may also incur an administrative fee but no such administrative fee will be deducted from your account prior to our having made reasonable efforts to contact you via the contact details last provided by you to Paddy Power. The administrative fee will be applied against the payments (including future payments) that would otherwise be payable to you. If you have any queries regarding inactive accounts, please contact us for further information.
</li>
<li>
Paddy Power shall provide you with statements accessible via www.paddypartners.com detailing the number of Customers and the revenues generated from those Customers, if any, which have accrued to you over the course of the previous calendar month. At the end of a calendar month, Paddy Power shall record your total share of Net Revenues, if any, during the previous calendar month. In the event that a revenue share in any calendar month is a negative amount, Paddy Power shall be entitled but not obliged to carry forward and set off such negative amount against future revenue shares which would otherwise be payable to you. Subject to these terms, if you select a Revenue Share deal, Paddy Power shall pay you in respect of each Customer the agreed percentage of Net Revenue from the date of first registration until the agreed customer expiry date - (i.e standard reward plan term is 2 year customer expiry). However, Paddy Power shall also be entitled but not obliged to zero the negative balance that would otherwise be carried forward. If a revenue share does not exceed €50, or currency equivalent, Paddy Power shall be entitled to withhold and carry forward such sum until the end of the first calendar month in which the revenue share (including any sum carried forward) exceeds €50, or currency equivalent, at which time payment shall be made in accordance with Clause 5.10. For the avoidance of doubt, you will only receive a payout when there is a positive balance and it is greater than €50, or currency equivalent, in any given month.

</li>
<li>
Unless otherwise agreed in writing, at the end of a calendar month, the relevant revenue share payable by Paddy Power to you shall be automatically raised and paid out (in accordance with Clause 5.5) within 60 days of the end of the relevant calendar month. Such revenue share shall be paid in either pounds sterling or Euro, inclusive of VAT if applicable, at Paddy Power's discretion.
</li>
<li>
You shall indemnify on demand and hold harmless us from and against any and all losses, demands, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including, but not limited to, consequential losses and loss of profit, reasonable legal costs and expenses and VAT thereon if applicable) and liabilities suffered or incurred, directly or indirectly, by Paddy Power in consequence of any breach by you of this Clause 5.11 or as a result of your VAT status being different from that notified to us.
</li>
<li>
Paddy Power may engage the services of a third party (currently "NetRefer") to provide both the affiliate platform and system maintenance. We have service levels in place and expect these to be upheld but ultimately we do not have total control over these services and therefore cannot be held responsible for any failures arising from such third party services. You shall cooperate with us, and to the extent necessary our third party service providers, to give effect to the terms and spirit of this Agreement.
</li>
<li>
We shall make reasonable efforts to make any payments due to you in a timely fashion. However, we shall not be liable for occasional delays or delays outside of our control. For example, any changes in the contact or banking details provided by you may give rise to a delay of up to 60 days in making any payments due. Where you become aware of any overdue payments due to you, please contact us immediately and we will seek to resolve the matter as soon as possible. Please note, we accept the following payment methods: Bank Wire Transfer (not including money transfer services/applications), Neteller and Skrill.
</li>
<li>
We shall use reasonable endeavours to make payments due to you using the payment details provided to us. However, in certain circumstances we may be unable to make payments to you for reasons outside of our control (for example where the bank account details provided are inaccurate or incomplete). Where this occurs, we shall make reasonable efforts for a period of up to six (6) months to contact you via the contact details last provided by you to Paddy Power to obtain alternative payment details. If we are still not in a position to make the payments after this period, we may close or suspend your account without further notice and you shall be deemed to have forfeited any entitlement to payment.
</li>
<li>
If an error is made in the calculation of your share of the revenue share, Paddy Power reserves the right to correct such calculation at any time and to reclaim from you any overpayment made by Paddy Power to you (including, without limitation, by way of reducing future payments which might otherwise be due to you from us from time to time).

<li>
In accordance with the terms of the licence conditions and codes of practice of the UK Gambling Commission (the “Commission”), Paddy Power is required to ensure that third parties shall, and therefore you undertake: (a) to conduct yourself in so far as you carry out any activities on behalf of Paddy Power as if you were bound by the same licence conditions and subject to the same codes of practice as Paddy Power, including but not limited to assisting Paddy Power in the display of such information and the provision of such links (for example a link to the Commission’s website) as may be required by the Commission; (b) to comply with any technical standards for remote gambling systems as may be set by the Commission; (c) to provide such information to Paddy Power as it may reasonably require in order to enable Paddy Power to comply with its information reporting and other obligations to the Commission; and (d) not to encourage players to play longer or wager more than the player might otherwise do.

In particular you: (a) shall have appropriate privacy and security safeguards in place; and (b) shall comply with your obligations in Clause 5.18(b) and Clause 3.7. You shall immediately comply with Paddy Power's requests in relation to this Clause 5.21. Where you fail to do so, Paddy Power reserves the right to immediately terminate this Agreement.

<strong>Errors</strong>
<ol>
<li>
Paddy Power makes every effort to ensure that no errors are made in the calculation of amounts due to affiliates. However, human, systems' and/or third party error may occasionally result in errors. Paddy Power reserves the right to correct any obvious errors and to void any payments (to include the right to be reimbursed where payments have been made in error) where such have occurred.
</li>
<li>
In the case of any blatant errors in payments made (including for example where the payment made is materially different to previous or comparable payments/periods and/or the payment is clearly incorrect, depending on all of the circumstances), the amount paid will be rebalanced at the appropriate rate. Should you be credited in error, it is your responsibility, and you undertake, to notify Paddy Power of the error without delay. You hereby undertake to provide your full cooperation to Paddy Power to correct any such errors, including by way of the return of any over-payments. Paddy Power may set off any payment obligation due to us from you against any future payment obligation owed by us to you under this Agreement.
